## 🎯 Design Rationale

### Visual Narrative Strategy

Each diagram serves a specific purpose in the liberation narrative:

**Partnership Split** → "Here's how accountability + healing infrastructure work together"
**Development Lab** → "Here's why we don't predetermine what to build"
**Embedded Roles** → "Here's systems change from inside institutions"
**ROI Comparison** → "Here's why this creates compounding value"
**Cost Comparison** → "Here's why prevention costs less than crisis"

### Color Storytelling

- **Red sections** = Financial accountability, urgent action, "Pay what you owe"
- **Teal sections** = Healing infrastructure, systems transformation, "Here's what healing looks like"
- **Gold accents** = Hope, community warmth, bridging accountability to transformation

Together, they tell the truth: **"Without community, there is no liberation"**
