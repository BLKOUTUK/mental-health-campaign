# Final Cost Model: Mental Health Reparations
## Under £500/Year - Community Assets + Legal Advocacy

**BLKOUT Working Document**
*For and by Black queer men in the UK*

---

## Cost Framework: £85.75 Million Over 5 Years

**Per person**: £2,450 over 5 years for 35,000 Black queer men in the UK

**That's £490 per person, per year.**

Less than the winter fuel payment every pensioner household receives.
Less than most people's monthly phone bill.
More transformative than any mental health spending in UK history.

---

## Psychological Framing: The £490 Threshold

**Why under £500/year matters**:
- Winter fuel payment: £500/year per pensioner household (universal benefit)
- If pensioners deserve £500/year for heating, Black queer men deserve £490/year for staying alive
- Under £500 feels reasonable, achievable, not excessive
- Easy comparison: "less than winter fuel allowance"
- Annual framing more comprehensible than 5-year total

**£490/year buys**:
- Community cultural centres where you belong
- Legal advocates fighting discrimination
- Peer coordinators catalysing mutual aid
- Crisis support when you need it
- Research that proves what we already know works
- Joy - because survival isn't enough

Each centre:
- Year 1: £1.5M (lease/acquisition, renovation, startup)
- Years 2-5: £875K/year (operations moving toward sustainability)
- By year 5: 40% earned income (venue hire, events, consultancy)

**Virtual Centre** (£5M over 5 years):
- National platform connecting all 35,000 Black queer men
- Digital peer support, online programming, democratic governance

- £1M development, £4M operations over 4 years

**Community Asset Model**:
- Owned/governed by communities served
- Revenue-generating specialisms
- Not dependent on perpetual grants
- Queer East model: https://www.queereast.co.uk/

---

### £25M Compensation: Peer Coordination + Legal Advocacy

**50 Peer Coordinators** (£7.5M over 5 years):
- 10 per physical centre region
- £25K/year salary (living wage, part-time/flexible)
- £5K/year local discretionary budget for micro-grants
- Catalysing existing mutual aid, not replacing grassroots organizing
- Total: 50 × £30K × 5 years = £7.5M

**Legal Advocacy Cadre** (£7.5M over 5 years):
- **15 Legal Advocates** working across UK regions
- Activating legal protections already in place (Equality Act 2010, Human Rights Act 1998)
- Bringing class actions against discriminatory institutions
- Seeking to improve legislation where gaps exist
- Strategic litigation challenging systemic barriers

**Legal Advocacy Roles**:
- Employment discrimination cases (unfair dismissal, hostile workplaces)
- Housing discrimination (evictions, refusal of tenancy due to sexuality/race)
- Healthcare negligence (NHS mental health services causing harm)
- Family law (parental rejection, inheritance disputes, next-of-kin rights)
- Immigration (LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, detention conditions)
- Police misconduct (harassment, violence, failure to protect)
- Class actions against institutions with patterns of discrimination

**Structure**:
- 15 advocates × £50K/year (solicitor/paralegal salaries) × 5 years = £3.75M
- £3.75M legal costs fund (court fees, expert witnesses, case preparation)
- Partnership with equality law firms (pro bono support, strategic advice)
- Training peer coordinators on basic legal rights and when to escalate

**Why Legal Advocacy Matters for Mental Health**:

- Family rejection is leading cause of suicidality in LGBTQ+ youth
- Police violence causes PTSD and institutional distrust
- Legal victories create material safety and psychological relief
- Class actions force systemic change, not just individual remedies
- Knowing you have legal backing reduces helplessness and isolation

**Therapy Subsidy** (£10M over 5 years):
- Sliding scale access to culturally competent therapy
- Subsidies for Black queer practitioners
- Training existing therapists in cultural competency
- Not building parallel system - improving access to what exists

## Legal Advocacy: Activating Existing Protections

### Laws Already on the Books That Aren't Being Enforced

**Equality Act 2010**:
- Prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and race
- Protected characteristics include both (intersectional discrimination recognized)
- Applies to employment, housing, healthcare, education, goods/services
- **Gap**: Individual enforcement burden, no proactive systemic accountability
- **Advocacy Role**: Class actions, strategic test cases, institutional monitoring

**Human Rights Act 1998**:
- Article 3: Freedom from torture and inhuman/degrading treatment (NHS mental health harm)
- Article 8: Right to private and family life (family rejection, police surveillance)
- Article 14: Freedom from discrimination in enjoyment of Convention rights
- **Gap**: Requires legal expertise to invoke, inaccessible to most
- **Advocacy Role**: Human rights litigation against state institutions

**Public Sector Equality Duty**:
- Requires public bodies to eliminate discrimination, advance equality, foster good relations
- Applies to NHS, police, local authorities, schools
- **Gap**: Rarely enforced, no consequences for non-compliance
- **Advocacy Role**: Judicial review challenging institutional failures

**Mental Health Act 1983 (amended 2007)**:
- Protections against arbitrary detention
- Right to advocacy during involuntary treatment
- **Gap**: Disproportionate detention of Black men, inadequate advocacy
- **Advocacy Role**: Challenging unlawful detentions, reforming detention criteria

**NHS Constitution**:
- Right to care without discrimination
- Right to be treated with dignity and respect
- Right to complain and have complaints properly investigated
- **Gap**: No teeth, NHS trusts ignore violations
- **Advocacy Role**: Systemic complaints, CQC referrals, litigation

### Strategic Litigation Priorities

**Employment Discrimination**:
- Class action against major employer with pattern of LGBTQ+ discrimination
- Test case on intersectional discrimination (race + sexuality compounding harm)
- Tribunal claims establishing mental health as disability under Equality Act

**Healthcare Negligence**:
- NHS mental health trust causing harm through racist/homophobic treatment
- Conversion therapy practices in NHS (still happening despite "ban")
- Inadequate care leading to preventable suicide (clinical negligence)

**Housing Discrimination**:
- Estate agents/landlords refusing LGBTQ+ tenants
- Evictions based on sexuality (illegal but happens)
- Social housing providers failing equality duties

**Police Misconduct**:
- Harassment of Black queer men in public spaces
- Failure to investigate hate crimes
- Discriminatory stop and search patterns
- Violence during mental health crisis callouts

**Family Law**:
- Parental rejection causing homelessness (duty of care to under-18s)
- Inheritance disputes (families excluding queer relatives)
- Next-of-kin rights (hospitals excluding chosen family)

**Immigration**:
- LGBTQ+ asylum seekers detained in unsafe conditions
- Home Office disbelieving sexuality claims (requiring "proof")
- Deportation to countries criminalizing homosexuality

### Why Legal Advocacy is Mental Health Intervention

**Material Safety Enables Mental Health**:
- Winning employment discrimination case = stable income = reduced anxiety
- Securing housing rights = stable home = PTSD recovery possible
- Police accountability = reduced hypervigilance, trauma from state violence
- Family law victories = financial security, acknowledgment of chosen family

**Systemic Change Reduces Ongoing Harm**:
- Class action changing NHS trust policy = thousands benefit
- Test case establishing intersectional discrimination precedent = easier future claims
- Strategic litigation forces institutional reform, not just individual remedy

**Empowerment Heals Helplessness**:
- Having legal advocate = knowing you're not alone against powerful institutions
- Winning case = proof that fighting back works
- Legal victory = public acknowledgment that yes, discrimination happened and was wrong

**Justice Enables Moving Forward**:
- Accountability for harm done allows psychological closure
- Financial compensation recognizes suffering wasn't imagined
- Institutional reform shows commitment to non-repetition
