## Core Principle

> **"Design choices are political choices. Let our themes reflect our values."**

This design system doesn't just make things look good - it tells the story of transformation from colonial harm to community healing. Every color, every font choice, every gradient serves the liberation message.

**Red** holds systems accountable.
**Teal** shows what healing looks like.
**Gold** connects them with hope.
**Together** they tell the truth: Without community, there is no liberation.
