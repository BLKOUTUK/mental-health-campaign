## Realistic, Sustainable, Community-Led Infrastructure

**BLKOUT Working Document**
*For and by Black queer men in the UK*

---

## New Cost Framework: £65 Million Over 5 Years

**Per person**: £1,857 over 5 years (£371/year) for 35,000 Black queer men in the UK

This revised model reflects:
- Community asset approach (sustainable, self-governing centres)
- Catalytic rather than service delivery model (50 peer coordinators, not 500 workers)
- Hybrid infrastructure (5 physical + 1 virtual centre)
- Specialism-led spaces (creative arts, entrepreneurship, digital communications)
- Comprehensive opportunity cost analysis (not just suicide prevention)
- Funding source agnosticism (innovative, diverse revenue streams)

## Revised Breakdown by UN Reparations Framework

### £25M Restitution: Community Asset Centres

**5 Physical Centres + 1 Virtual Hub** - Sustainable community assets with specialist focuses

**Physical Centres** (£4M each × 5 = £20M over 5 years):
- **London** (Newham/Swiss Cottage): Creative arts specialism - performance spaces, studios, galleries, cultural programming rooted in African/Caribbean traditions
- **Manchester**: Entrepreneurship hub - business incubation, economic cooperation, mutual aid infrastructure
- **Birmingham**: Digital communications centre - media production, podcast studios, platform development, tech skills
- **Bristol**: Healing arts - movement, music therapy, spiritual practices, somatic healing
- **Leeds/Glasgow/Cardiff** (rotating model): Flexible space adapting to regional needs

**Virtual Centre** (£5M over 5 years):
- National platform connecting all physical spaces
- Digital programming accessible to 35,000 Black queer men regardless of location
- Online peer support networks
- Virtual events, workshops, resources
- Democratic governance infrastructure for community ownership

**Community Asset Model** (inspired by Queer East: https://www.queereast.co.uk/):
- Centres owned/governed by communities they serve
- Revenue-generating activities (venue hire, paid events, consultancy) create sustainability
- Partnership with local authorities, arts councils, universities for facility sharing
- Not dependent on perpetual external funding
- Each centre develops specialism that serves whole network

**Cost per centre breakdown**:
- Year 1: £1M (acquisition/lease deposit, renovation, initial staffing)
- Years 2-5: £750K/year (operations, programming, part-time staff, moving toward sustainability)
- By year 5: centres generating 30-50% of operating costs through earned income

---

### £20M Compensation: Catalytic Peer Coordination

**50 Peer Coordinators** - Not service delivery workers, but community catalysts

**Role Definition**:
- Not replacing community organizing with paid jobs
- Catalysing and connecting existing mutual aid, peer support, cultural work
- Small locally determined budgets to resource grassroots activity
- Facilitating networks, not managing services

**Structure**:
- 10 coordinators per physical centre (5 centres × 10 = 50 total)
- Virtual centre coordinators work across regions without physical centres
- £25K/year salary (living wage, part-time/flexible - many doing this alongside other work)
- £5K/year discretionary budget per coordinator for micro-grants to community initiatives

**Total**: 50 coordinators × £30K (salary + budget) × 5 years = £7.5M

**Therapy & Support Subsidy**: £12.5M over 5 years
- Sliding scale therapy access
- Cultural competency training for existing therapists
- Subsidies for Black queer practitioners
- Not building parallel system - improving access to what exists

**Why 50 not 500**:
- Avoids recreating professional service bureaucracy
- Keeps power with grassroots organizers
- Prevents "NGO-ification" of community work
- More dynamic, responsive, community-controlled
- Coordinators amplify existing work, don't replace it

---

### £15M Rehabilitation: Research, Crisis, Joy

**£8M Research & Knowledge Infrastructure**:
- Participatory action research led by Black queer communities
- Documentation of pre-colonial histories and colonial erasure
- Evaluation of liberation practices as mental health interventions
- Training curriculum for peer coordinators
- Public education countering harmful narratives
- Not academic extraction - community-owned knowledge production

**£4M Crisis Infrastructure**:
- Peer-led crisis response training and coordination
- Safe spaces during mental health emergencies
- Alternatives to police response and forced hospitalization
- Community-based safety planning
- Rapid response networks leveraging existing relationships

**£3M Joy Interventions**:
- Arts programming, social events, creative expression
- Celebration as healing, play as trauma release
- Community festivals, creative projects, cultural production
- Recognition that healing requires more than treating harm

---

### £5M Satisfaction: Truth, Acknowledgment, Visibility

**Public Education & Truth-Telling**:
- Campaigns countering stereotypes and colonial narratives
- Memorial projects for those lost to state violence and systemic neglect
- Community-led documentation of histories mainstream institutions erased
- Platform for testimony and acknowledgment
- Creates conditions for trust and partnership

**Why This Matters for Mental Health**:
- Gaslighting heals when truth is publicly acknowledged
- Invisibility harms; visibility and recognition heal
- Collective memory work addresses intergenerational trauma
- Social acknowledgment that "yes, this happened and it was wrong" enables moving forward

---

### £0 Guarantees of Non-Repetition

**Removed from cost model** - These should be institutional commitments, not things communities pay for:
- Policy reforms embedding structural change
- Community oversight mechanisms in existing institutions
- Legal protections against backsliding

**Rationale**:
- Government/institutions should fund their own accountability structures
- Communities shouldn't pay for systems to stop harming them
- Non-repetition requires institutional culture change, not community budgets

---

## Comprehensive Opportunity Cost Analysis

### Beyond Suicide: The Real Costs of Inequality

**Suicide prevention** (£3.12M per death) is important but widely derided as inflated. The compelling case comes from comprehensive inequality costs:

**Secure Units & Crisis Hospitalizations**:
- Psychiatric inpatient care: £350-500/day
- Average stay: 4-6 weeks = £10K-21K per admission
- Secure units for those deemed "high risk": £200K-300K/year
- Black men over-represented in restrictive settings
- Peer support reducing crisis admissions saves tens of thousands per person prevented

**Under & Unemployment**:
- Mental health conditions keep capable people out of workforce
- Lost tax revenue + benefit payments = £8K-15K/person/year
- Multiply by working-age population experiencing preventable mental health crisis
- Peer support, cultural reclamation, community connection enable economic participation
- ROI: people working and contributing vs. locked out of economy

**Loneliness Among Elders**:
- Social isolation costs NHS £162/person/year (national average)
- Higher for LGBTQ+ elders facing family rejection and erasure
- Hospital admissions, GP visits, medication for loneliness-related conditions
- Community centres providing intergenerational connection prevent costly isolation

**Bed-Blocking Due to Lack of Care**:
- NHS bed costs £400-500/day when patient medically ready for discharge
- Lack of community support infrastructure delays discharge
- Peer coordinators connecting to mutual aid and community care enable discharge
- Savings: hundreds of pounds per day per bed freed

**Addiction Treatment**:
- Residential rehab: £6K-15K per month
- Outpatient programmes: £1K-3K
- High relapse rates when treatment doesn't address root causes (trauma, isolation, discrimination)
- Community connection, cultural reclamation, peer support address causes of self-medication
- Prevention + sustained recovery cheaper than repeated treatment cycles

**HIV Transmission**:
- Lifetime HIV treatment costs: £380K-450K per person
- Mental health crisis, isolation, discrimination increase HIV risk behaviors
- Community connection, peer support, access to affirming healthcare reduce transmissions
- Prevention investment ROI: massive savings per transmission prevented

**Homelessness**:
- Emergency accommodation: £100-200/night
- Outreach services, healthcare for rough sleepers
- Mental health crisis major factor in housing instability
- Mutual aid networks, peer coordinators with local budgets prevent homelessness
- Prevention saves emergency response costs

**Cumulative Inequality Gap**:
- Health inequalities cost UK economy £31-33 billion/year (Marmot Review)
- Closing mental health inequality gap for 35,000 Black queer men:
  - Reduced NHS costs (admissions, secure units, medications)
  - Increased economic participation (tax revenue, reduced benefits)
  - Prevented homelessness, addiction treatment, HIV transmissions
  - Reduced social care costs (loneliness, discharge delays)

**Conservative Estimate**:
- If inequality gap costs £5K-10K per person per year (healthcare + economic + social care)
- 35,000 people × £7,500 average × 5 years = £1.3 billion in preventable costs
- £65M investment preventing even 10% of inequality costs = £130M saved
- 2:1 ROI at minimum; likely 5:1 or better when fully accounting for compounding effects

## Funding Source Agnosticism: Innovative Revenue Streams

**Not dependent on single source or government grants**:

**Government**:
- NHS mental health budgets (prevention saves treatment costs)
- Department for Culture, Media & Sport (community arts centres)
- Local authorities (community asset transfers, facility partnerships)
- Arts Council England (cultural programming grants)

**Corporate/Business**:
- Corporate mental health CSR budgets
- Tech companies (digital communications centre)
- Creative industries (arts centre partnerships)
- Social investment/impact bonds (measurable outcomes)

**Philanthropy**:
- Health equity foundations
- LGBTQ+ grant-makers
- Arts & culture funders
- Community asset development trusts

**Earned Income** (30-50% of centre operations by year 5):
- Venue hire (events, meetings, conferences)
- Paid cultural programming (concerts, festivals, exhibitions)
- Consultancy (training for institutions on co-production, cultural competency)
- Digital platform subscriptions/premium features
- Entrepreneurship hub business incubation revenue share
- Media production/content creation

**Community Fundraising**:
- Membership models (sliding scale, no one excluded by inability to pay)
- Community shares/cooperative ownership
- Crowdfunding for specific projects
- Benefit events and galas

**Innovative Models**:
- Community land trusts acquiring property
- Social impact bonds (investors paid based on measurable outcomes)
- NHS prevention budget partnerships (savings-sharing agreements)
- University research partnerships (co-produced knowledge)

---

## Why This Model Works Better

**Sustainability**:
- Community assets that generate revenue, not perpetual grant dependence
- Diverse funding streams reduce vulnerability
- Earned income creates financial autonomy

**Dynamic & Responsive**:
- 50 catalytic coordinators, not 500 service workers
- Small local budgets respond to community-identified needs
- Avoids bureaucratic service delivery model

**Community-Controlled**:
- Democratic governance at every level
- Specialist centres serve whole network
- Knowledge and resources flow between regions

**Evidence-Based ROI**:
- Comprehensive opportunity cost analysis (not just suicide)
- Measurable outcomes across health, economic, social domains
- Conservative 2:1 return; likely 5:1+ when fully accounting for inequality closure

**Realistic & Achievable**:
- £65M over 5 years more viable than £130M
- £371/person/year feels accessible
- Hybrid physical/virtual model serves 35,000 people with 6 centres
- Community asset approach proven (Queer East model)
