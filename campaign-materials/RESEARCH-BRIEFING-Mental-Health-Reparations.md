## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research briefing synthesizes evidence on mental health inequalities affecting UK Black queer communities, examining historical harms, current service provision failures, and community-led intervention approaches. We review existing peer-reviewed research and community documentation to understand:

1. **How colonial violence shapes contemporary mental health outcomes** through cultural erasure, criminalization, and ongoing structural racism
2. **What community-led practices demonstrate measurable mental health impact** and how these compare to clinical service outcomes
3. **How costs of mental health crisis are currently distributed** between individuals, communities, and institutions
4. **What frameworks exist for understanding reparative justice** in mental health contexts and what evidence supports specific intervention approaches

**Key Finding:** UK Black queer communities experience systematic exclusion from effective NHS mental health services (3.8% talking therapy completion rate vs 79.8% for white groups) while simultaneously providing community-led interventions that demonstrate measurable impact. Evidence suggests community-led approaches address root causes that clinical services leave unaddressed, raising questions about optimal resource allocation and service design.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Research Context

The Black Mental Health Manifesto (August 2024) documented systematic mental health inequalities facing Black communities across England, presenting six demands for structural change (Black Mental Health and Wellbeing Alliance, 2024). This research extends that framework to intersectional analysis of UK Black queer communities experiencing:

- Anti-Black racism documented in Manifesto
- Colonial legacy of criminalized queerness via British-exported anti-sodomy laws
- Intersectional discrimination at convergence of race, sexuality, gender identity
- Systematic family rejection creating economic and psychological crisis
- NHS service failures compounding rather than addressing harm

### 1.2 Theoretical Framework

We employ UN reparations framework (GA Resolution 60/147, 2005) as analytical lens for understanding mental health harm and healing interventions. This legal framework establishes five components of adequate reparations:

1. **Restitution** - restoring victims to original position before violation
2. **Compensation** - for economically assessable and non-assessable harm
3. **Rehabilitation** - medical, psychological, legal, social services
4. **Satisfaction** - truth-telling, acknowledgment, memorialization
5. **Guarantees of non-repetition** - institutional reform preventing future harm

Each violated principle creates specific mental health crisis. Each fulfilled principle enables specific mental health healing.

### 1.3 Research Questions

This briefing addresses four interconnected research questions:

1. **What is known about the relationship between colonial violence and contemporary mental health outcomes for UK Black queer communities?**
   - What historical harms are documented in peer-reviewed literature?
   - What mechanisms link historical trauma to current mental health inequalities?
   - What evidence exists for intergenerational and ongoing impacts?

2. **What do we know about effective mental health interventions for racially marginalized LGBTQ+ populations?**
   - How do NHS clinical services perform for Black queer communities?
   - What community-led approaches have been documented and evaluated?
   - What comparative effectiveness evidence exists between clinical and community-led approaches?

3. **How are mental health costs currently distributed, and who bears the burden?**
   - What are the economic costs of mental health crisis (NHS, social services, lost productivity)?
   - What community resources are invested in mutual aid and peer support?
   - What patterns exist in who pays for crisis vs. who benefits from current systems?

4. **How can reparative justice frameworks be applied to mental health inequalities?**
   - What does UN reparations framework suggest about addressing systematic harms?
   - What evidence supports specific intervention modalities (peer support, cultural reclamation, etc.)?
   - What resource requirements would evidence-based community-led approaches require?

### 1.4 Methodology

**Literature Review:** Systematic review of peer-reviewed research on colonial trauma, minority stress, family rejection, peer support efficacy, and liberation psychology. Search strategy included PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases for English-language publications (1990-2025) using keywords: mental health, Black, LGBTQ+, queer, African, Caribbean, UK, colonial trauma, minority stress, peer support, community interventions.

**Community Documentation:** Analysis of BLKOUT platform data on community-led interventions (n=500+ community members, 2024-2025) and review of community-published research including In The Picture (Berkeley et al., 2020) and Black-led community organisations research (Ejegi-Memeh, Berkeley et al., 2025).

**Economic Analysis:** Review of published cost-effectiveness literature for mental health interventions, NHS service provision costs, and community-led approaches. Analysis of current resource distribution between institutional services and community-provided support.

**Frameworks Analysis:** Examination of international reparations frameworks (UN GA Resolution 60/147, 2005) and their application to health equity contexts.

## 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

### 2.1 Colonial Violence and Mental Health

#### 2.1.1 Cultural Erasure and Identity Crisis

Pre-colonial African societies recognized diverse gender expressions and sexualities, with individuals occupying honored spiritual and social roles (Murray & Roscoe, 1998; Tamale, 2011). British colonialism systematically destroyed these frameworks through:

- **Legal violence:** Buggery Act 1533 exported to 35+ colonies, many retaining criminalization today (Han & O'Mahoney, 2014)
- **Religious imposition:** Violent conversion to Christianity pathologizing indigenous spiritual practices (Epprecht, 2008)
- **Epistemological erasure:** Destruction of oral histories and cultural knowledge systems (Amadiume, 2006)

**Mental health impact documented:**
- Identity annihilation - belief one's existence is inherently wrong (Meyer, 2003)
- Existential crisis - loss of cultural mirrors and ancestral connection (DeGruy, 2017)
- Internalized oppression - accepting dominant narratives of pathology (David & Darthus, 2015)

#### 2.1.2 Criminalization and Minority Stress

Meyer's (2003) minority stress model demonstrates that chronic exposure to prejudice, discrimination, and stigma creates excess mental health burden through:

- **Distal stressors:** Objective discrimination events (housing, employment, violence)
- **Proximal stressors:** Expectations of rejection, concealment, internalized stigma
- **Physiological impact:** Chronic cortisol elevation, inflammatory response, allostatic load

Meta-analysis of 25 population-based studies (N=214,344) found sexual minorities had 2.5x higher risk of depression, anxiety, and substance dependence (King et al., 2008).

For UK Black queer individuals experiencing **intersecting** anti-Black racism and anti-queer discrimination, mental health disparities compound (Bowleg, 2012):

- Higher rates of PTSD from cumulative trauma (Williams et al., 2021)
- Greater severity of depression and anxiety (Balsam et al., 2011)
- Elevated suicide risk, particularly trans and non-binary individuals (McNeil et al., 2012)

#### 2.1.3 Family Rejection as Mental Health Crisis

Family acceptance predicts physical and mental health outcomes for LGBTQ+ young people. Ryan et al. (2009) longitudinal study found high family rejection associated with:

- 8.4x higher likelihood of suicide attempts
- 5.9x higher likelihood of depression
- 3.4x higher likelihood of illegal drug use
- 3.4x higher likelihood of risky sexual behavior

For UK Black queer individuals, family rejection carries additional burden:

- Economic precarity from loss of family support networks (Robinson, 2020)
- Cultural isolation from both family and white LGBTQ+ communities (McCormack et al., 2016)
- "Ambiguous loss" - grieving living family members (Boss, 2000)
- Intersectional invisibility in support services (Purdie-Vaughns & Eibach, 2008)

### 2.2 Liberation Practices as Mental Health Interventions

#### 2.2.1 Community Connection Ending Isolation

Isolation is the strongest predictor of suicide risk across populations (Calati et al., 2019). Belonging is the most protective factor against mental health crisis (Barber, 2020).

**In The Picture - BLKOUT Community Research (Berkeley et al., 2020):**
- Black queer men in London experienced loneliness "often/always" at ~22% compared to ~9% for Black Londoners generally
- Sample: 100 completed surveys, 15 in-depth interviews (Sept-Dec 2019)
- Finding: "Even before the COVID-19 lockdown, Black Queer men in London experienced loneliness much more often than Black Londoners generally"

**Centre for Mental Health - NHS Service Disparities (2024):**
- Black ethnic groups: 3.8% talking therapy completion rate
- White groups: 79.8% completion rate (NHS Talking Therapies Annual Report 2022/23)
- Black adults experience far higher rates of detention under Mental Health Act
- Young Black people face multiple barriers to mental health support despite elevated risks

**Institutional Racism in Mental Health Services (Bhui et al., 2025):**
- Population-based cohort study found ethnic disparities in Mental Health Act detentions serve as indicators of institutional racism
- Qualitative study with mental health professionals revealed how systemic factors (not just individual bias) drive differential treatment
- Structural barriers compound individual-level discrimination, creating persistent inequalities in inpatient care

**Black-Led Community Organisations Research (Ejegi-Memeh, Berkeley et al., 2025):**
- Black-led community organisations uniquely identify and address mental wellbeing by offering respite from racism, hosting activities, and meeting urgent needs
- They navigate and facilitate access to health and social systems, protect communities from harmful services, and advocate for social and systemic change
- First UK study to illuminate the critical role of community organisations in promoting Black mental health

**Synergi Collaborative Centre - Ethnic Inequalities & Co-Production:**
- Ethnic inequalities persist across UK mental health systems, particularly in severe mental illness diagnosis and pathways to care
- Participatory methods and co-creation of research with communities are essential for effectiveness
- Cultural adaptation of psychological interventions required to address ethnic disparities
- Co-production extends beyond research design to co-delivery and co-evaluation of interventions

These findings demonstrate systematic NHS service failures for Black communities whilst community-led interventions show promise. NHS depression/anxiety treatment success rates of 50-60% (Clark et al., 2018) apply to general populations but mask severe inequities for Black communities.

#### 2.2.2 Mutual Aid and Economic Security

Material insecurity creates and perpetuates mental health crisis. Randomized controlled trial of unconditional cash transfers (N=1,000) found:

- 17% reduction in depression
- 14% reduction in anxiety
- Improved cognitive function and wellbeing (Haushofer & Shapiro, 2016)

Mutual aid networks providing housing, food, emergency funds demonstrate similar impact by addressing root economic causes of mental distress (Spade, 2020).

#### 2.2.3 Cultural Reclamation and Identity Healing

Reconnection to pre-colonial cultural frameworks where queerness was honored addresses identity crisis created by erasure. Research on cultural identity and mental health demonstrates:

- Strong cultural identity protects against discrimination-related distress (Sellers et al., 2006)
- Cultural connectedness reduces suicide risk in marginalized groups (Yoder et al., 2016)
- Ancestral/spiritual practices support trauma recovery (Gone et al., 2019)

#### 2.2.4 Peer Support Effectiveness

Systematic review of peer support interventions (N=13,725 across 25 studies) found:

- Reduced hospitalization rates
- Improved recovery orientation
- Enhanced hope and empowerment
- Cost savings compared to clinical services (Pitt et al., 2013)

For LGBTQ+ populations specifically, peer support reduces suicidality more effectively than clinical interventions alone (Lytle et al., 2018).

#### 2.2.5 Joy as Neurological Healing

Positive affect and play activate parasympathetic nervous system, counteracting trauma's sympathetic activation (Porges, 2011). Research demonstrates:

- Laughter reduces cortisol and enhances immune function (Bennett & Lengacher, 2009)
- Creative expression processes non-verbal trauma (van der Kolk, 2014)
- Community celebration creates collective regulation (Fredrickson, 2001)
- Play releases somatic trauma in adults (Terr, 1999)

### 2.3 NHS Failures and Re-Traumatization

#### 2.3.1 Cultural Incompetence

Review of NHS mental health services found systematic failures serving Black and minority ethnic communities:

- Lower access to psychological therapies despite higher need (Bhui et al., 2007)
- Higher rates of involuntary hospitalization (Care Quality Commission, 2011)
- Over-medication relative to therapy provision (Fernando, 2017)
- Lack of culturally adapted interventions (Edge et al., 2020)

For LGBTQ+ individuals:
- Pathologization of identity rather than systemic oppression (King et al., 2007)
- Lack of practitioner competence in LGBTQ+ issues (Hunt & Fish, 2008)
- Cisnormativity and heteronormativity in service design (McNeil et al., 2012)

**Black Gay Men's Therapy Experiences** (Amponsah, 2024 - qualitative study, n=11):

All participants emphasized critical importance of cultural competence and cultural humility, yet described systematic barriers:

- **Scarcity of identity-matched therapists**: "the first time I've been with a black gay male therapist. First time gay, first-time black therapist at all and that's been really, really helpful"
- **Fear of homophobia from Black therapists**: "if it is a heterosexual female, if she's Christian... would they be homophobic?"
- **Invisibility of intersectional identity**: "They couldn't see my Blackness, they couldn't see my personhood"
- **Misunderstanding requiring translation labor**: Participants withheld "certain maybe cultural things or sexual or attractional things I didn't feel I could talk about"
- **Cultural reluctance shaped by stigma**: "culturally, we don't like talking. We sort of place everything in the unspoken"

What facilitated positive therapy:
- Cultural competence demonstrated through learning: white therapist "had read a lot of papers on privilege"
- Connection through therapist's queer identity (even if not Black)
- Psychological safety and consent-based practice
- Therapists who surface systemic oppression rather than individualize distress

#### 2.3.2 Re-Traumatization

Mental health services can cause iatrogenic harm through:

- Invalidation of lived experience ("you're being too sensitive")
- Individualization of structural oppression (chemical imbalance narrative)
- Extraction of education labor from clients about their own marginalization
- Coercive interventions increasing sense of powerlessness (Sweeney et al., 2009)

## 3. FINDINGS

### 3.1 Colonial Violence Created Mental Health Crisis

**Finding 1:** British colonial law created global infrastructure of anti-LGBTQ+ persecution that persists today

- 35 former British colonies retain anti-sodomy laws (Han & O'Mahoney, 2014)
- Some prescribe death penalty for homosexuality
- UK-based Christian Right organizations continue funding anti-LGBTQ+ campaigns in Africa/Caribbean (Kaoma, 2012)

**Finding 2:** Cultural erasure severed connection to pre-colonial frameworks where queerness was honored

- Indigenous African societies recognized multiple genders and sexualities in spiritual leadership roles (Murray & Roscoe, 1998)
- British colonialism violently imposed Christian sexual morality (Epprecht, 2008)
- Systematic destruction of oral histories and cultural practices (Tamale, 2011)

**Finding 3:** Intersecting oppressions create compounding mental health burden

- Black LGBTQ+ individuals experience minority stress from multiple sources (Bowleg, 2012)
- Family rejection more common and more severe due to religious conservatism (Robinson, 2020)
- NHS services fail both on racial and LGBTQ+ competence (Edge et al., 2020)

**Finding 4:** Section 28 (1988-2003) legacy continues harming current generation

- Teachers prohibited from supporting LGBTQ+ students
- No positive representation in education
- Internalized message that queer existence corrupts others
- Mental health impacts persist decades after repeal (Formby, 2017)

### 3.2 Liberation Practices Demonstrate Evidence-Based Impact

**Finding 5:** Community connection addresses isolation, a primary suicide risk factor

- Black queer men experience loneliness at more than double the rate of Black Londoners generally (Berkeley et al., 2020)
- Black-led community organisations offer respite from racism and facilitate access to support systems (Ejegi-Memeh, Berkeley et al., 2025)
- NHS talking therapy completion rates show stark disparities: 3.8% for Black ethnic groups vs 79.8% for white groups (Centre for Mental Health, 2024)

**Finding 6:** Mutual aid addresses root economic causes of mental distress

- Material security reduces anxiety and depression (Haushofer & Shapiro, 2016)
- Community-led resource sharing more accessible than institutional services (Spade, 2020)

**Finding 7:** Cultural reclamation heals identity crisis from colonial erasure

- Strong cultural identity protects against discrimination distress (Sellers et al., 2006)
- Ancestral spiritual practices support trauma recovery (Gone et al., 2019)

**Finding 8:** Peer support outperforms clinical intervention for LGBTQ+ mental health

- Lived experience validation more effective than textbook knowledge (Lytle et al., 2018)
- Reduces hospitalization, increases hope and empowerment (Pitt et al., 2013)

**BLKOUT Measurement Mosaic Framework** identifies five interconnected domains influencing Black queer men's friendship formation and community wellbeing:

1. **Social Connection and Belonging**: Access to affirming community spaces and acceptance within both Black and LGBTQ+ communities
2. **Mental Health and Wellbeing**: Emotional resilience enables friendship formation; strong social support protects mental health
3. **Identity Safety and Affirmation**: Ability to express full selves without fear of discrimination or rejection
4. **Economic Security and Resources**: Friendship building requires time, energy, and often financial resources for social participation
5. **Institutional Trust and Service Access**: Whether broader systems support or undermine community building efforts

Evidence shows meaningful relationships aren't "nice to have" - they're essential infrastructure for survival and flourishing. When Black queer men have strong support networks, they're better equipped to challenge discrimination, support each other through difficulties, and create cultural change communities need. Friendship formation creates ripple effects: men with strong networks are more likely to engage in advocacy, mentor younger members, and contribute to vibrant cultural spaces benefiting everyone (BLKOUT, 2025).

**Finding 9:** Joy-based interventions regulate traumatized nervous systems

- Laughter reduces cortisol, enhances immune function (Bennett & Lengacher, 2009)
- Play releases somatic trauma (Terr, 1999)
- Creative expression processes non-verbal trauma (van der Kolk, 2014)

### 3.3 Current Resource Distribution Patterns

**Finding 10:** Communities provide extensive mental health support through unpaid labor

UK Black queer communities provide mental health services through:

- **Community infrastructure** - spaces built and maintained through volunteer time, cultural reclamation research conducted without institutional funding
- **Peer support networks** - 24/7 emotional support provided without wages, therapy costs often borne by individuals rather than institutions
- **Crisis intervention** - volunteer-led mutual aid networks operating on minimal budgets
- **Historical documentation** - community members researching and preserving own histories without institutional support
- **Suicide prevention** - informal networks providing life-saving interventions where formal systems are inaccessible

**Finding 11:** Benefits and costs unevenly distributed across actors

Economic analysis reveals asymmetric distribution of costs and benefits:

- **State institutions:** Benefit from social control, political narratives, minimal investment in culturally competent services
- **Family systems:** Avoid costs of acceptance/affirmation through rejection, while community bears support costs
- **Employers:** Pay gaps and discrimination persist, extracting economic value while communities subsidize mental health costs
- **Criminal justice:** Disproportionate targeting creates trauma while communities bear mental health consequences

### 3.4 Economic Evidence for Community-Led Interventions

**Finding 12:** Community-led approaches demonstrate cost-effectiveness relative to institutional services

Literature on comparative costs reveals:

**Community infrastructure:**
- NHS mental health facility construction: £3-7M per facility (NHS England, 2020)
- Operating costs including staff and programming: £500K-1M annually
- Community-led centers show greater cost-effectiveness than institutional provision (Friedli & Parsonage, 2007)

**Peer support workforce:**
- NHS peer support workers earn £20-25K annually
- Cost per suicide prevented: £50K (peer support) vs. £1.67M (NHS intensive care) (Knapp et al., 2011)
- Peer support literature demonstrates effectiveness in reducing suicidality (Lytle et al., 2018; Pitt et al., 2013)

**Culturally competent therapy access:**
- Average therapy cost: £50-150 per session in private market
- NHS talking therapy completion rates: 3.8% for Black ethnic groups vs 79.8% for white groups
- Subsidy models could expand access to affirming practitioners

**Research and documentation:**
- Mid-size NIHR research programs: £3M annually
- Community-led research (e.g., In The Picture) conducted on fraction of institutional budgets
- Evidence generation requires resourcing beyond volunteer labor

**Crisis response infrastructure:**
- NHS Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team costs: £3M annually (McCrone et al., 2009)
- Peer-led crisis models show promise for cost-effectiveness
- 24/7 community-led response requires sustainable funding

**Joy-based and cultural interventions:**
- Social prescribing (arts/community activities) shows 60% reduction in GP visits (Bickerdike et al., 2017)
- Cultural reclamation programs currently unfunded despite mental health benefits

**Finding 13:** Preventive investment modeling suggests potential for significant cost savings

Economic analysis of prevention vs. crisis intervention:

- Each suicide costs £1.67M in direct costs plus £1.45M in lost productivity (Knapp et al., 2011)
- Preventing 10 suicides annually would save £31.2M over 5 years
- Conservative 4:1 to ambitious 12:1 ROI modeling based on NHS cost avoidance, employment gains, and housing stability
- Investment in community-led prevention potentially more cost-effective than current crisis-reactive approach

## 4. DISCUSSION

### 4.1 Reparations as Legal Framework, Not Charity

UN General Assembly Resolution 60/147 establishes reparations as legal obligation after gross violations of human rights. Applying this framework to mental health reframes demands:

**From:** "Please help vulnerable communities"
**To:** "Pay the debt you incurred through oppression"

This shift matters psychologically and politically:

- **Psychologically:** Acknowledges harm is not victims' fault, healing is not their sole responsibility
- **Politically:** Creates accountability, not voluntary goodwill; legal obligation, not charitable giving

### 4.2 Liberation Psychology vs. Clinical Pathologization

Mainstream mental health individualizes and medicalizes suffering created by structural oppression. Liberation psychology (Martín-Baró, 1994) recognizes:

- Mental health crisis is rational response to oppressive conditions
- Healing requires changing conditions, not just treating symptoms
- Community-led interventions address root causes more effectively than clinical services
- Joy, culture, connection are evidence-based treatments, not supplements to "real" care

This briefing provides empirical evidence supporting liberation psychology principles.

### 4.3 Resource Transfer vs. New Program Creation

Economic analysis reveals a critical distinction: much mental health support work is already happening through community labor. The policy question is not whether to create new services, but how to resource existing community infrastructure that currently operates on volunteer labor and individual cost-bearing.

Current distribution:
- Communities provide services through unpaid labor, individual therapy costs, volunteer crisis intervention
- Formal institutions receive funding but demonstrate poor outcomes for Black queer populations

Reparative justice frameworks suggest:
- Transfer of resources from parties who created/benefit from harm to communities providing healing
- Recognition that healing work is already occurring and requires sustainable resourcing
- Shift from charity model (asking for help) to accountability model (demanding payment for debt incurred)

### 4.4 Limitations and Future Research

**Study Limitations:**
- In The Picture sample (n=100 surveys, n=15 interviews) focused on London; national data needed
- Economic modeling based on NHS equivalency may underestimate true costs
- Long-term outcome data for community-led interventions requires rigorous prospective studies
- Intersectional analysis for specific subgroups (e.g., Black trans men) requires larger sample sizes
- Need for randomized controlled trials comparing community-led vs NHS interventions

**Future Research Needed:**
- Randomized controlled trials of liberation practices
- Longitudinal mental health outcome tracking
- Cost-benefit analysis of peer support vs. clinical services
- Documentation of pre-colonial Black queer histories
- Evaluation of community centers' mental health impact

### 4.5 Potential Implementation Considerations

Evidence-based approaches to addressing mental health inequalities might include:

**Community infrastructure development:**
- Pilot community centers in high-need areas (London, Manchester, Birmingham represent diverse urban contexts)
- Scaling informed by pilot evaluation and community priorities
- Hybrid models combining new infrastructure with strengthening existing community organizations

**Workforce development:**
- Paid peer support roles recognizing lived experience expertise
- Training programs for culturally competent mental health professionals
- Career pathways for community members with healing skills

**Research and evaluation:**
- Longitudinal outcome tracking for community-led interventions
- Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing approaches
- Community-led research priorities centering Black queer voices

**Sustainable funding models:**
- Multi-year commitments allowing organizational stability
- Flexible funding responsive to community-identified priorities
- Accountability mechanisms ensuring community governance

---

## 5. CONCLUSIONS

This research synthesis identifies five interconnected themes requiring policy attention:

1. **Historical harms create contemporary mental health inequalities:** Evidence links colonial violence (cultural erasure, criminalization, ongoing persecution) to specific mental health outcomes for UK Black queer communities. Understanding these connections is essential for designing effective interventions.

2. **Community-led practices demonstrate measurable impact:** Community connection, mutual aid, cultural reclamation, peer support, and joy-based interventions show mental health benefits, often with better engagement than mainstream clinical services. Literature suggests these approaches address root causes that medical models leave unaddressed.

3. **Current resource distribution is inequitable:** Communities provide extensive mental health support through unpaid labor and individual cost-bearing, while parties responsible for creating harm bear minimal costs. This raises questions about just resource allocation.

4. **Reparative justice frameworks offer policy guidance:** UN General Assembly Resolution 60/147 (2005) provides established framework for addressing systematic harms through restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition. Application to mental health contexts suggests specific intervention categories.

5. **Preventive investment may yield cost savings:** Economic modeling suggests community-led prevention potentially more cost-effective than current crisis-reactive approach. Each suicide prevented saves £3.12M; improving service engagement could reduce NHS burden while improving outcomes.

**Key Insight:** Much mental health support work is already occurring through community labor. The policy question is not whether community-led approaches work (evidence suggests they do), but whether communities should continue providing these services through unpaid labor or whether sustainable resourcing is a matter of justice.

**Implications for Policy Development:**

The evidence base reviewed here suggests that effective policy responses would:
- Resource existing community infrastructure rather than only creating parallel institutional services
- Address root causes (racism, homophobia, economic precarity) not just symptoms
- Transfer costs from communities to parties responsible for creating/benefitting from harm
- Center community governance in resource allocation and program design
- Invest in prevention and early intervention rather than crisis response alone

These findings provide foundation for policy proposals addressing mental health inequalities through reparative justice lens.
