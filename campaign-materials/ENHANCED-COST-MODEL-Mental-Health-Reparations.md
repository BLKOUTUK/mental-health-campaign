## Core Framing: Beyond Equality Before the Law

**Racism and homophobia created systems that deny dignity and humanity.**

Equality legislation alone cannot undo centuries of cultural harm. Legal protections matter, but they're insufficient when institutions remain structurally unchanged and communities lack resources to enforce rights or build alternatives.

**Repair is what makes equality real.**

This is investment in Black queer men that transforms life opportunities - not through rhetoric about inclusion, but through material infrastructure that enables thriving. Cultural change requires culture-building. Relationship transformation requires relationship infrastructure. Dignity restoration requires spaces where dignity was never questioned.

**This could restore Britain's moral leadership globally.**

While other nations debate reparations abstractly, UK could demonstrate reparative justice in practice: community-owned infrastructure addressing historical harm, evidence-based interventions preventing ongoing crisis, democratic governance ensuring power remains with those affected. International model for how wealthy nations address inequality through partnership, not paternalism.

## Cost Framework: £95 Million Over 5 Years

**Per person**: £2,714 over 5 years for 35,000 Black queer men in the UK

**That's £543 per person, per year.**

Slightly above winter fuel payment threshold, but with enhanced infrastructure:
- Radical democracy through cooperative ownership
- Community-owned media enabling co-production, co-delivery, co-evaluation
- Community land trust building housing + cultural hubs
- Global demonstration project for reparative justice in practice

## Revised Breakdown by UN Reparations Framework

### £40M Restitution: Community Assets + Housing

**Community Land Trust** (£15M over 5 years):
- Acquire land/property removing it from speculative market
- Democratic community governance of assets
- Build affordable housing for Black queer men (20-30 units)
- Develop 2 of 5 cultural hubs on trust-owned land
- Permanent community ownership preventing displacement
- Revenue from affordable rents funds ongoing operations

**Why Housing is Mental Health Infrastructure**:
- Housing insecurity causes chronic anxiety, PTSD from evictions
- Homophobic families rejecting LGBTQ+ youth = youth homelessness crisis
- Racist housing discrimination = unstable living situations
- Community land trust = permanent affordable housing = stability enabling healing
- Living near cultural hub = embedded in community = reduced isolation
- Tenant democracy = agency and power = psychological empowerment

**5 Physical Cultural Centres** (£20M over 5 years):
- **2 on Community Land Trust property** (London, Manchester): £5M each = £10M
  - Permanent community ownership
  - Integration with affordable housing (residents walk to cultural programming)
  - Revenue model: ground floor cultural/commercial, upper floors housing

- **3 Leased/Partnership Centres** (Birmingham, Bristol/Cardiff, Leeds/Glasgow): £3.33M each = £10M
  - Partnership with local authorities, universities, arts venues
  - Lower capital costs, flexible regional adaptation
  - Moving toward sustainability through earned income

**Specialist Focuses**:

**15 Legal Advocates** (£7.5M over 5 years):

- **Enabling co-production extending to co-delivery and co-evaluation**:
  - Communities don't just inform research - they produce media showing what works
  - Peer-created content = co-delivery (community delivering mental health intervention through storytelling)
  - Audience engagement data = co-evaluation (communities assessing impact of their own work)

**Media Co-op Infrastructure**:

**Why Media is Mental Health Infrastructure**:
- Representation heals invisibility - seeing yourself reflected in media

- Co-production builds agency - not subjects of research, creators of knowledge
- Documentation creates accountability - institutions can't deny what's filmed
- Media jobs provide economic opportunity - worker-ownership builds wealth
- Global distribution counters harmful narratives - Black queer joy and thriving visible worldwide

**Therapy Subsidy** (£5M over 5 years):

## Radical Democracy: Cooperative Ownership at Every Level

**Community Land Trust**:
- Land/housing owned collectively by community
- Democratic governance (one member, one vote)
- Permanent affordability (removed from speculative market)
- Revenue supports community priorities, not private profit
- Prevents gentrification and displacement

**Media Cooperative**:
- Worker-owned by Black queer media makers
- Democratic decision-making on content, priorities, revenue distribution
- Profits reinvested in cooperative or distributed to worker-owners
- No external investors extracting value
- Builds wealth within community

**Cultural Centre Governance**:
- Membership model (35,000 Black queer men eligible)
- Democratic decision-making on programming, budgets, policies
- Board elected by membership (one member, one vote)
- Transparency and accountability to community
- Power remains with those served, not funders or institutions

- No surveillance capitalism or corporate extraction
- Technology serving community, not corporations

**Why Radical Democracy Matters for Mental Health**:
- Agency heals helplessness - having real power over your life

- Ownership creates security - can't be displaced or shut down by external forces
- Collective governance reduces isolation - connected to community through shared power
- Economic democracy addresses poverty - worker ownership builds wealth

## Co-Production Extending to Co-Delivery and Co-Evaluation

**Traditional Model** (extraction and paternalism):
- Researchers study communities → Academic papers communities never read
- Institutions deliver services TO communities → No community control
- External evaluators assess "effectiveness" → Communities excluded from defining success

**Co-Production Extended Model** (power and partnership):

**Co-Production** (communities shaping what gets created):
- Participatory action research - communities design research questions
- Media co-op planning - communities decide what stories matter
- Centre programming - communities vote on what cultural offerings to prioritize
- Legal advocacy priorities - communities identify which fights matter most

**Co-Delivery** (communities delivering interventions):
- Peer coordinators = community members delivering mental health support
- Media co-op = community members creating content that heals through representation
- Cultural centre programming = community members teaching, performing, facilitating
- Legal advocacy = community members supporting each other through institutional navigation
- Crisis response = community members intervening in each other's emergencies

**Co-Evaluation** (communities assessing what worked):
- Media co-op documenting in real-time = communities showing their own transformation
- Democratic governance = communities voting on whether centres meeting needs
- Peer coordinator feedback loops = communities telling coordinators what's working
- Research dissemination through accessible media = communities determining how knowledge shared
- Legal advocacy impact tracked by community-defined metrics (not just cases won, but material safety felt)

**Why This Matters**:
- Communities are experts on their own lives
- Co-evaluation recognizes community knowledge as valid data
- Media documenting intervention = communities showing (not being shown)
- Democratic ownership = evaluation isn't external judgment but internal reflection
- Success defined by those affected, not institutions or funders
