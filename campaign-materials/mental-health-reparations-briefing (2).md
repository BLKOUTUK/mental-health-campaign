# MENTAL HEALTH REPARATIONS BRIEFING
## For UK Black Queer Communities

*"The tree remembers what the axe forgets." - African Proverb*

---

## IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE BLACK MENTAL HEALTH MANIFESTO

This briefing stands on the foundation laid by the **[Black Mental Health Manifesto](https://www.bmhwa.co.uk/the-manifesto)**, launched in August 2024 by the Black Mental Health and Wellbeing Alliance. The Manifesto presents six powerful demands for structural change to close the inequality gap for Black people in mental health services across England. It calls for comprehensive accountability from government, commissioners, service providers, practitioners, educational institutions, and community organizations.

But there is a seventh story the Manifesto points toward but does not fully explore—the story of those of us who exist at the intersection of Blackness and queerness in the UK. Those of us who face not only the anti-Black racism the Manifesto addresses, but also the colonial legacy of violently imposed anti-LGBTQ+ laws. Those of us whose families rejected us, leaving scars the mental health system cannot see. Those of us whose ancestors were honored as spiritual leaders and healers before colonialism taught the world to fear and criminalize us.

This briefing extends the Manifesto's framework to our intersectional reality. We use the United Nations' legal definition of reparations—not as metaphor, but as international law—to hold specific parties accountable for specific harms. We show how oppression created our mental health crisis, how liberation practices are healing it, and how £110 million transfers payment from the victims currently bearing the cost to the institutions that created the debt.

Together, we demand mental health justice for all Black people in the UK.

## PART 1: THIS IS AN ACCOUNT

The word "account" carries three meanings, each essential to understanding what follows.

First, it is **financial**—a ledger of what is owed. Society incurred a debt through centuries of oppression. That debt has a price, calculated according to international law and the actual cost of healing the harm done.

Second, it is **historical**—a testimony of what happened. The tree remembers what the axe forgets. This account documents the colonial violence that destroyed our ancestors' honored roles, the laws that criminalized our existence, the families that cast us out, the businesses that profited from our invisibility, the police who failed to protect us, and the mental health crisis these systems created.

Third, it is **accountability**—naming who caused harm and demanding they answer for it. Not abstract "society." Not vague "systems." Specific institutions. The UK State. Families. Businesses. Police. Each consumed something they did not pay for. Each benefitted while victims paid the price.

The axe forgets. The tree remembers. Community is memory. This briefing is accountability.

### ⚠️ THE BILL IS BEING PAID—BY THE VICTIMS

Here is what most people misunderstand about unpaid debts: they do not go unpaid. Someone always pays. Right now, that someone is us.

Society's oppression created a mental health crisis among UK Black queer communities. We are currently paying society's debt with our lives, our labor, our health, and our futures.

Consider what £110 million in mental health services looks like when victims are forced to provide it themselves:

**£50 million in restitution**—restoring the cultural and spiritual roles colonialism stole from us. We are paying this by building BLKOUT in our spare time, creating community centers in underfunded spaces, researching our erased histories without institutional support, reclaiming spiritual practices our ancestors were murdered for teaching. Unpaid labor, worth millions.

**£35 million in compensation**—for the material harm of discrimination and the immaterial harm of trauma. We are paying this through lost wages when employers refuse to hire us, lost careers when we cannot advance, lost lives when early death claims those who could not survive the stress. We are paying through the decades of earning potential stolen by family rejection that left us homeless in our youth, through the therapy bills we cannot afford, through working twice as hard to prove we deserve the jobs we already have.

**£25 million in rehabilitation**—for recovery services that understand our specific harm. We are paying this by providing peer support to each other without compensation, holding friends through crisis at 3am, teaching each other grounding techniques, creating mutual aid networks to catch those the system lets fall, organizing healing circles in our living rooms because the NHS fails us.

**£15 million in satisfaction**—for truth-telling and acknowledgment. We are paying this by researching and documenting our own histories while those who erased them stay silent, educating the public about harm they could learn about themselves if they cared to, creating art and writing that testifies to what happened while perpetrators claim ignorance.

**£5 million in guarantees of non-repetition**—for crisis infrastructure to prevent future harm. We are paying this by preventing each other's suicides, creating safety plans, building networks to respond to crisis, checking in on isolated community members, doing the work of keeping each other alive that police and mental health services refuse to do.

Meanwhile, those who created this debt—the State, families, businesses, police—received the benefits of our oppression without paying its cost.

The State gained social control, political scapegoating, and the power to enforce conformity across society by excluding us. Families maintained their reputations, kept inheritances in "acceptable" family lines, and avoided difficult conversations by discarding their queer children like defective products. Businesses profited from pay gaps, paid less for invisible labor, and found discrimination cheaper than equity. Police met arrest quotas with easy targets, harassed vulnerable communities instead of doing actual police work, and raided our gathering places instead of solving real crimes.

They consumed. We paid. They benefitted. We suffered.

This briefing demands one simple transfer: **move the payment from victims to responsible parties**.

Every day you delay, victims keep paying your bill with their lives.

## PART 2: HOW OPPRESSION CREATED MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS

The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 60/147, adopted in 2005, establishes the legal framework for reparations after gross violations of human rights. It outlines five principles that together constitute adequate reparations: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition.

These are not abstract ideals. They are requirements under international law. And each one, violated, creates specific mental health harm to UK Black queer communities.

### 1. RESTITUTION: Restoring What Was Stolen

Imagine, for a moment, being honored for who you are.

In many indigenous African spiritual and cultural practices before colonialism, people we would today call queer held respected positions as spiritual leaders, healers, mediators between worlds. Yoruba traditions recognized múltiple genders. Various West and Central African societies honored those who existed outside rigid gender binaries as possessing special spiritual sight. We were not tolerated. We were not "included." We were integral—seen as gifts to our communities, bridges between the physical and spiritual realms.

Then came the violence of colonial "civilization."

The transatlantic slave trade, beginning in 1619, ripped millions from societies where they had status and spiritual purpose. The British Empire imposed Christianity violently, erasing indigenous practices and teaching that our ways were savage, our spirituality demonic, our existence an abomination. The Buggery Act of 1533 became the template for anti-LGBTQ+ laws exported to over 35 former British colonies, many of which still criminalize homosexuality today—some with death penalties.

The colonial "civilizing mission" did not merely conquer land. It conquered memory. It destroyed the possibility of knowing we had ever been honored. It erased the knowledge that people like us were once seen as powerful, not pathological.

This erasure created a specific mental health crisis: **identity annihilation**.

When you grow up never seeing yourself reflected in history, you develop the persistent, gnawing belief that people like you don't exist—or shouldn't. When every religious text you encounter condemns you, every historical account erases you, every family story skips over ancestors like you, the message embeds itself deep in your psyche: "I don't belong. I shouldn't be here. My existence is a mistake."

This is not ordinary depression. This is **existential erasure**. The feeling that your very being is wrong. That you are a corruption of what should have been. That everyone would be better off if you simply didn't exist.

And here is the UK's ongoing role in this harm: 35 former British colonies still enforce the anti-sodomy laws Britain imposed. Some punish homosexuality with death. And UK-based Christian Right organizations continue to fund campaigns to uphold and expand these laws—exporting money and ideology to ensure that the colonial violence against queer people never ends.

No acknowledgment. No apology. No effort to repair. Just ongoing funding for the persecution of people whose ancestors Britain taught to fear and criminalize us.

**Restitution** under international law means restoring victims to the position they would have been in had the violation not occurred. For UK Black queer communities, that means reclaiming the knowledge that we were once honored, restoring the spiritual practices that recognized our gifts, creating community spaces where we lead and heal as our ancestors did, and funding research to document what colonialism tried to erase forever.

Restitution is not about nostalgia for a past we can never fully recover. It is about healing the identity crisis created by erasure. It is about knowing, in your bones, that people like you have always existed and were once honored for it. It is about rebuilding the spiritual and cultural infrastructure that colonialism destroyed—so that the next generation of Black queer youth do not grow up believing they are mistakes.

---

### 2. COMPENSATION: Payment for Harm Done

Reparations under UN framework require compensation for two kinds of harm: material and immaterial.

Material harm is straightforward to calculate. Generations of UK Black queer people were denied employment due to criminalization of our identities—first explicitly under anti-sodomy laws, then through discrimination that remains legal in practice if not in name. Housing discrimination, family rejection creating homelessness, hostile environment policies blocking access to services and documentation, educational exclusion through bullying and lack of protection, criminal records for "homosexual offenses" preventing employment long after decriminalization—all of these create measurable economic harm.

The NHS mental health system's failures compound this. Untreated mental health conditions reduce earning potential across a lifetime. Discrimination causes people to work twice as hard for half the recognition. Pay gaps persist. Glass ceilings remain. And the economic stress of survival mode makes healing impossible—therapy costs money people living in poverty don't have, rest requires security people facing housing instability cannot access.

But the deeper, more devastating harm is **immaterial**—the suffering and loss of dignity that no amount of money can truly compensate, but that international law nonetheless requires payment for.

Consider the intergenerational trauma that began with slavery, continued through colonial imposition of violent homophobia, and persists in ongoing persecution that UK organizations still fund. Consider the loss of ancestral knowledge—spiritual practices that could have sustained us, cultural traditions that could have given meaning, healing methodologies that might have saved lives. Consider the psychological harm of being erased from history and excluded from the present, of fighting daily just to justify your existence while watching others take theirs for granted.

Consider family rejection.

For many UK Black queer people, the moment of coming out—or being discovered—becomes the moment of exile. Parents who raised you declare you dead to them. Siblings you grew up with are forbidden from contact. Grandparents grieve you as if you died, because to them, you did. The child they knew is gone, replaced by something they were taught to fear and reject.

This creates a specific mental health crisis that therapists call "ambiguous loss"—grieving someone who is alive. Your family is alive, but dead to you. You are alive, but dead to them. There is no funeral, no closure, no community support for mourning, because officially, no one died. You are simply expected to move on from losing everyone you loved, everyone who was supposed to protect you, everyone whose job it was to ensure you survived to adulthood.

And the mental health impact is devastating: anxiety from economic precarity, trauma responses to poverty and housing instability, chronic stress from survival mode that never ends, the inability to afford therapy or rest, and the internalized belief that maybe you deserve this struggle—maybe the family who rejected you was right.

Section 28—the UK law from 1988 to 2003 that prohibited "promoting homosexuality" in schools—meant generations of young people went through their entire education never once hearing that people like them existed in a positive light. Teachers could not support bullied queer students. Schools could not provide resources. The message was clear: you are so wrong, so dangerous, that merely acknowledging your existence might corrupt others.

The Windrush scandal disproportionately harmed Black LGBTQ+ people, many of whom lacked family support to navigate the hostile environment. The asylum system continues to fail those fleeing the very homophobic laws Britain exported. Police violence and discrimination persist. Employment inequality continues.

**Compensation** under international law acknowledges that money cannot restore dignity, cannot bring back lost years, cannot heal the wounds of rejection and erasure. But it can resource the healing work that might. It can pay for therapy that understands this specific harm. It can fund peer support workers who have lived it themselves. It can provide the material security that makes recovery possible—because no one heals while struggling to survive.

Compensation is not charity. It is payment for harm caused. It is transferring the cost of healing from those who were harmed to those who caused and benefitted from that harm.

### 3. REHABILITATION: Services That Actually Heal

Four hundred years of accumulated trauma—from slavery, colonialism, ongoing persecution—requires rehabilitation services that understand the specific harm and provide culturally competent care.

The NHS mental health system fails UK Black queer communities not because its practitioners lack good intentions, but because it was built to pathologize us rather than heal us. When a Black queer person experiencing depression walks into an NHS mental health service, the system sees individual pathology—chemical imbalance, disordered thinking, maladaptive coping—rather than the completely rational response to living under intersecting oppressions.

The therapist asks about childhood and family relationships, and when you explain that your family rejected you for being queer, there is a note in the file about "family conflict" but no acknowledgment that family rejection is a documented mental health crisis with specific interventions. The psychiatrist prescribes antidepressants for the symptoms without ever addressing the systemic causes—the employment discrimination keeping you in poverty, the housing instability creating chronic stress, the cultural erasure making you feel like you don't exist.

The system treats you as broken when the world around you is what broke. It individualizes what is collective, medicalizes what is political, and pathologizes what is actually survival.

This creates a specific mental health harm: **re-traumatization by the systems meant to heal you**.

Every time you walk into a mental health service and have to explain from scratch why being rejected by your family and erased from history might affect your mental health, you are doing unpaid education labor. Every time a practitioner without lived experience suggests solutions that show they don't understand ("just set boundaries with your family"), you are reminded that you are alone in this. Every time you encounter waiting lists, gatekeeping, and hostile environments in supposedly "helping" services, the message reinforces: you are not worth the effort it would take to actually help you.

And the worst part is that while you are being failed by services that claim to help, the trauma keeps accumulating. Depression untreated becomes worse. Anxiety without intervention escalates. Suicidal ideation without culturally competent crisis support leads to preventable deaths.

**Rehabilitation** under international law requires medical, psychological, legal, and social services specifically designed to support recovery from the specific harms suffered. For UK Black queer communities, this means peer support from those with lived experience who understand without explanation. It means research to develop evidence-based interventions for colonial trauma and intersectional harm. It means crisis support infrastructure that recognizes that calling the police during a mental health crisis can make things worse, not better. It means long-term support, not just crisis intervention, because healing from 400 years of harm takes more than six sessions of CBT.

It means joy-based interventions that recognize healing is not just clinical—that sometimes what traumatized nervous systems need is not one more therapy session, but a dance party. That community celebration and creative expression and collective joy are not frivolous additions to "real" treatment, but essential components of recovery from harm that tried to destroy our aliveness.

Rehabilitation is about creating the conditions where healing becomes possible—and recognizing that those conditions look different for people whose harm was caused by the very systems meant to protect them.

### 4. SATISFACTION: Truth-Telling When No One Will Listen

In 1954, Alan Turing—the brilliant mathematician whose work helped end World War II—was chemically castrated by the British state for being gay. Two years later, he died. The official cause was ruled suicide by cyanide poisoning, though some dispute this. What is not in dispute is that Britain destroyed him for loving men.

Turing received a royal pardon in 2013, nearly 60 years after his death. But thousands of other men convicted under the same laws have never been pardoned. Thousands more died without ever being acknowledged. And the harm continues—35 former British colonies still criminalize homosexuality with laws Britain imposed.

Yet there has been no official acknowledgment from the UK government of its role in creating global homophobia. No truth commission examining colonial violence against LGBTQ+ people. No public education about how British law exported death penalties for queerness to countries that now enforce them with UK Christian Right financial support. No memorialization of those lost. No apology to the communities still suffering. Just silence.

And that silence creates a specific mental health harm: **gaslighting on a societal scale**.

When no one acknowledges that harm happened, you start to doubt your own experience. Did the violence occur? Was it as bad as you remember? Are you being too sensitive? Should you just get over it? The lack of social acknowledgment makes you question your own reality, internalize oppression, and blame yourself for your suffering.

Audre Lorde wrote, "Your silence will not protect you." But the corollary is also true: **their silence harms you**. When perpetrators refuse to speak about what they did, when institutions deny the harm they caused, when society erases the history you lived through, the message is clear—what happened to you doesn't matter. You don't matter enough for the truth to be told.

This is why survivors often say that apology and acknowledgment matter more than money. Because when someone says, "Yes, this happened. Yes, it was wrong. Yes, you deserved better"—that validation breaks the isolation of unacknowledged suffering. It confirms you are not crazy for feeling harmed. It affirms that your experience was real and that the responsibility belongs with those who caused it, not with you for failing to recover from it.

**Satisfaction** under international law requires acknowledgment of harm through official apologies, truth-telling, memorialization of victims, and public education. For UK Black queer communities, this means the UK government acknowledging its role in creating global homophobia through colonial law. It means a truth commission examining the ongoing UK funding of anti-LGBTQ+ persecution. It means memorials to those lost to state violence, family rejection, and systemic neglect. It means curriculum changes teaching this history so the next generation knows what happened and how to prevent it from happening again.

Satisfaction is not about feeling better. It is about breaking the gaslighting. It is about official acknowledgment that confirms your reality, validates your harm, and places responsibility where it belongs—with those who caused it.

### 5. GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION: Can't Heal While Being Harmed

Here is the devastating truth about trying to heal from trauma while still experiencing it: you can't.

Healing requires safety. Safety requires the harm to stop. But for UK Black queer communities, the harm continues.

UK organizations still fund anti-LGBTQ+ campaigns in Africa and the Caribbean. The NHS still fails to provide culturally competent mental health care. Hostile environment policies still affect Black queer asylum seekers fleeing persecution from laws Britain imposed. Employment discrimination persists, despite being technically illegal. Housing inequality continues to push Black queer people into homelessness and instability. Police still fail to protect LGBTQ+ people from hate crimes while continuing to harass and over-police Black communities. And no institutional accountability mechanisms ensure these failures are addressed.

This creates a specific mental health crisis: **complex PTSD from ongoing trauma**.

Complex PTSD develops when trauma is not a single event in the past but an ongoing condition of the present. Your nervous system cannot recover because it is still in threat mode. You cannot let your guard down because the danger is real. You develop hypervigilance—constantly scanning for threats, never able to trust that you are safe, always waiting for the next harm.

And when well-meaning people suggest therapy or healing practices, you want to scream: "I can't heal while I'm still being harmed!" The depression is not irrational—it is the completely rational response to a hopeless situation. The anxiety is not disordered—it is your nervous system correctly assessing that the threats are ongoing. The anger is not "something to work through"—it is the appropriate response to continued injustice.

**Guarantees of non-repetition** under international law require institutional reform to prevent future violations. For UK Black queer communities, this means ending all UK funding for anti-LGBTQ+ persecution globally. It means NHS reform to ensure culturally and intersectionally competent mental health services. It means ending hostile environment policies that harm Black queer asylum seekers. It means enforcing employment and housing protections, not just having them on paper. It means police reform with community accountability. It means education reform that reverses Section 28's legacy by teaching Black queer history.

But reform takes time. And while institutions slowly change—if they change at all—people are dying.

This is why the £5 million for crisis support infrastructure is not optional. It is the guarantee of non-repetition while the guarantees are still being established. It is community-led safety nets that prevent suicides while you fix the systems. It is peer-led crisis intervention that keeps people alive while the NHS learns to not harm them. It is proof of concept for what works, creating pressure for system reform by showing there is a better way.

Guarantees of non-repetition are not about trusting institutions to protect us. We know they won't. They are about creating community infrastructure that ensures our survival regardless of whether systems change—and demanding those systems fund it, since their failures made it necessary.

---

## PART 3: WE ARE FREEING OURSELVES FROM YOUR DEBT

The most important thing to understand about this briefing is that we are not begging for help.

We are working to free ourselves from the debt you placed on us—and we're succeeding. With or without your support, liberation is happening. The question is whether you will stop extracting payment from victims and transfer it to those responsible, or whether you will continue to benefit while we pay with our lives.

Because liberation is not a future dream. It is the work we are doing right now.

---

### Liberation as Mental Health: A Different Framework

The mainstream mental health system treats our suffering as individual pathology requiring clinical intervention. We see it differently.

Oppression creates mental health crisis. Liberation heals it.

This is not metaphor. This is materially, measurably true. When we end isolation through community connection, depression rates drop. When we create economic security through mutual aid, anxiety decreases. When we reclaim cultural identity through ancestral practices, the existential crisis of erasure heals. When we build peer support networks, suicide rates decline. When we experience collective joy, traumatized nervous systems regulate.

Liberation practices are mental health interventions—often more effective than clinical services, because they address root causes rather than symptoms.

Consider BLKOUT, our community-owned platform. On the surface, it is events calendars, networking hubs, news sections, democratic governance structures. But functionally, it is mental health infrastructure.

Isolation is the number one risk factor for suicide. Belonging is the strongest protective factor against mental health crisis. When you can open BLKOUT and see what's happening this weekend, find events near you, connect with other Black queer people, see yourself reflected in community news—that is not social networking. That is suicide prevention. That is mental health intervention through ending isolation.

Consider mutual aid networks where community members support each other with housing, food, bills, emergency funds. Mainstream mental health would call this "social services" or "poverty alleviation," separate from mental health care. But anxiety is materially created by economic insecurity. When you are housed, fed, financially stable—your nervous system can finally exit survival mode long enough to heal. Mutual aid is mental health treatment through material security.

Consider cultural reclamation—reconnecting to ancestral spiritual practices, learning pre-colonial history where we were honored, creating new traditions rooted in old wisdom. This is not nostalgia or cultural programming. This is healing from identity erasure. When you learn that your ancestors were spiritual leaders, not sinners—when you reconnect to practices that recognize your queerness as gift, not curse—the internalized homophobia that tells you "you shouldn't exist" begins to dissolve. Cultural reclamation is mental health intervention through identity healing.

Consider peer support—people with lived experience holding space for others navigating the same systems, sharing wisdom that comes from survival, validating experiences that clinical "experts" don't understand. When someone who has lived through family rejection helps you process yours, when someone who survived suicidality guides you through crisis, when someone who rebuilt after losing everything shows you it's possible—that is more powerful than any therapy session with someone who learned about your experience from a textbook. Peer support is mental health care through lived experience wisdom.

Consider joy as resistance—celebration, play, pleasure, art, music, dance, creativity, laughter, aliveness. Trauma traps the nervous system in survival mode—fight, flight, freeze. Joy is the signal that tells your body "you are safe enough to feel good." Play releases trauma stored in the body. Pleasure counteracts pain. Community celebration creates collective regulation. Laughter is neurologically healing. Joy is not frivolous or superficial—it is a mental health intervention through nervous system healing.

This is what we are building while paying your debt. This is the liberation work that is healing mental health more effectively than the systems that fail us.

---

### What We're Accomplishing With Nothing

BLKOUT, our community-owned platform, is being built by volunteers in their spare time. People with full-time jobs, mental health struggles, family obligations—giving hours they don't have to create infrastructure their communities desperately need.

Mutual aid networks operate on shoestring budgets and donated resources. People experiencing poverty themselves sharing what little they have to keep others from drowning. Organizers burning out trying to fill gaps that billion-pound institutions refuse to address.

Peer support happens at 3am when someone in crisis texts a friend because the NHS mental health crisis line put them on hold for 45 minutes. It happens in living rooms where healing circles meet because no one can afford to rent space. It happens through unpaid emotional labor that prevents suicides the system would call "inevitable."

Cultural reclamation happens through independent researchers working without institutional support, artists creating on poverty budgets, spiritual practitioners teaching what they learned from elders while working multiple jobs to survive.

Joy as resistance happens in community gatherings organized by people who give their weekends, rent spaces with personal credit cards when funding falls through, create celebration out of scraps because they know their communities need it to survive.

We are doing the work of £110 million in mental health services with virtually no resources—and it is working better than the services with billion-pound budgets.

Imagine what we could do if we weren't paying your bill.

Imagine what we could do if the £110 million transferred from victims to responsible parties, resourcing the leaders already doing this work. Imagine peer support workers earning living wages instead of burning out from unpaid labor. Imagine community centers in permanent spaces instead of borrowed rooms. Imagine research fully funded instead of squeezed into spare time. Imagine crisis infrastructure that can operate 24/7 instead of relying on exhausted volunteers.

Imagine liberation work that doesn't require people to sacrifice their own wellbeing to serve the collective.

This is not a dream. This is the concrete, measurable impact of transferring £110 million from those paying the debt to those who incurred it.

---

## PART 4: FUND THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WORK

The £110 million demanded in this briefing is calculated according to UN reparations principles and allocated to specific interventions with proven mental health impact. This is not experimental. This is resourcing liberation work that is already healing mental health more effectively than failed NHS services.

### £50M RESTITUTION: Restoring Honored Roles

Ten community-led centers across the UK, each serving as a space where Black queer people lead, teach, and heal as our ancestors did before colonialism destroyed those roles.

These are not clinical mental health facilities. They are liberation spaces. Imagine walking into a building where everything—from the spiritual practices offered to the art on the walls to the governance structure—centers Black queer leadership and wisdom. Where you are not a patient being treated, but a community member coming home. Where your queerness is not tolerated but celebrated as gift. Where you learn that your ancestors held honored roles as spiritual leaders and healers, and you are invited to reclaim that legacy.

This is not symbolic. This is material mental health intervention through cultural restoration.

Each center would include: community organizing space for building collective power, cultural programming reconnecting people to ancestral practices, healing offerings blending traditional and contemporary methods, research facilities documenting erased histories, gathering spaces for celebration and ceremony, and resources for practical support like job training and housing assistance.

The mental health impact is measurable. Depression decreases when people have purpose, status, and belonging. Anxiety reduces when there is stable community infrastructure. Identity crisis heals when you reclaim stolen cultural knowledge. Suicidality declines when you are embedded in community that sees you as essential, not expendable.

At £5 million per center for five years of operation—including space, staff, programming, and resources—ten centers across the UK would cost £50 million. This is 0.07% of the annual NHS England budget. It is less than Britain spends on royal ceremonies. It is a rounding error in government spending.

But for UK Black queer communities, it would be transformative mental health infrastructure that addresses root causes, not just symptoms.

**Who pays:** Primarily the State. You stole these roles through colonialism. You destroyed these spaces through Section 28. You failed to create alternatives when you finally decriminalized us. This is restoration of what you took.

---

### £35M COMPENSATION: Paying for Harm Done

#### £25M: Peer Support Workers

Five hundred trained peer support workers across the UK, earning living wages for the emotional labor they already do without compensation.

These are not social workers with textbook knowledge. These are people with lived experience of family rejection, employment discrimination, mental health crisis, and survival against systems designed to break them—who are now supporting others through the same struggles.

They would provide: crisis intervention when someone is suicidal, community outreach to isolated individuals, navigation support for NHS and social services, facilitation of healing circles and support groups, practical assistance with housing and employment, connection to mutual aid resources, and witnessing for those who need someone to confirm their reality.

The mental health impact is proven. Peer support reduces suicide rates—people in crisis are more likely to reach out to someone who has been there than to a professional who learned about it in school. It reduces isolation by creating relationships rooted in shared experience. It increases access to care—peer workers meet people where they are, not where the system decides they should be. It improves outcomes because intervention that understands context is more effective than treatment that pathologizes survival strategies.

At £10,000 per year per worker (living wage, not poverty stipend) for five years, 500 peer support workers would cost £25 million.

**Who pays:** Businesses. You profited from our invisible labor. You paid us less because we had to hide. You denied advancement to those who wouldn't perform heterosexuality. You bought our work while refusing to see us. This is backpay for the emotional labor we've been doing without compensation—keeping each other alive because you wouldn't.

#### £10M: Therapy Subsidy

Financial assistance for culturally competent therapy, removing the economic barrier that prevents most Black queer people from accessing the clinical support they need.

Not NHS services that re-traumatize. Not practitioners who make us educate them about intersectionality during sessions we're paying for. Therapy from providers who understand colonial trauma, family rejection, intersectional oppression—or at least are willing to learn and take that work on themselves, not extract it from clients.

This provides: sliding scale fees so no one is excluded by cost, stipends for therapy with Black queer practitioners when available, supplement to NHS services for those who need both peer support and clinical care, financial assistance for specialized trauma treatment, and support for long-term healing, not just six-session limits.

At £2 million per year for five years, this funds ongoing therapy subsidy for thousands of people who currently cannot afford healing.

**Who pays:** Families. You rejected your children, creating the trauma they now need therapy to recover from. You chose reputation over relationship, comfort over compassion, conformity over your own children's survival. This is payment for healing the wounds you inflicted.

---

### £25M REHABILITATION: Recovery from 400 Years

#### £15M: Research Initiative

Black queer-led research developing the evidence base for interventions that actually work for our communities, documenting the histories colonialism erased, and creating the knowledge infrastructure liberation requires.

This includes: documentation of pre-colonial Black queer roles and colonial erasure, development of culturally specific mental health interventions, training programs for peer support workers, evaluation of liberation practices as mental health treatment, publication and public education to dismantle colonial narratives, and memorial projects honoring those lost to state violence and systemic neglect.

The mental health impact is direct. Truth-telling heals gaslighting—research confirms that yes, this happened, yes, it was wrong. Reclaiming history heals identity crisis—learning your ancestors were honored transforms how you see yourself. Evidence-based interventions improve outcomes—when treatment is designed for your specific reality, it works better. Public education creates social acknowledgment—your suffering is no longer invisible or deniable.

At £3 million per year for five years, this creates comprehensive research infrastructure that serves not just UK Black queer communities but global movements learning from our work.

**Who pays:** The State. You erased our history. You silenced our truth. You refused to acknowledge the harm. This is payment for reclaiming what you destroyed.

#### £5M: Crisis Infrastructure

Twenty-four-hour peer-led crisis intervention, creating alternatives to police response and involuntary hospitalization that often make mental health crisis worse instead of better.

This provides: trained peer responders available 24/7, safe spaces for people in crisis who need somewhere to be, community-based safety planning instead of institutional control, rapid response teams for suicide prevention, and practical support like transportation, food, and temporary housing during crisis.

The mental health impact is life-saving. Suicide prevention through intervention by people who understand what you're going through. Reduced hospitalization by providing community alternatives. Reduced police harm—peer response instead of armed officers who escalate. Increased trust in crisis support—reaching out won't result in loss of control. Better outcomes from culturally competent care that sees crisis as human response to inhuman conditions, not individual pathology.

At £1 million per year for five years, this creates the infrastructure that prevents preventable deaths while the NHS learns to stop causing harm.

**Who pays:** Police. You failed to protect us from violence. You harassed us instead of serving us. You responded to mental health crisis with force instead of care. This is payment for the safety infrastructure you refused to create.

#### £5M: Joy-Based Interventions

Arts programs, community celebrations, creative expression, play, pleasure, and collective joy as mental health healing for nervous systems traumatized by 400 years of oppression.

This includes: music, visual arts, theater, and dance programs, community celebrations and cultural festivals, creative workshops for processing trauma through art, play-centered activities for adults reclaiming childhoods stolen by survival mode, and support for joy as resistance—celebration as political act and healing practice.

The mental health impact is neurological. Joy regulates traumatized nervous systems—tells your body the danger has passed, you can feel good now. Pleasure counters pain—interrupts the neural loops of trauma. Creative expression processes emotion that words cannot reach. Play releases trauma stored in the body. Community celebration creates collective healing—shared joy is more powerful than individual therapy.

At £1 million per year for five years, this funds the joy infrastructure that helps traumatized communities remember how to feel good—not as escape from the work, but as essential component of healing.

**Who pays:** The State. You tried to destroy our joy, our culture, our celebration. You criminalized our gathering places. You raided our clubs. You taught us that our existence was shameful. This is payment for reclaiming the aliveness you tried to kill.

### SATISFACTION & GUARANTEES: What Money Cannot Buy

The research initiative funds satisfaction through truth-telling—documenting what happened, educating the public, creating memorials, providing evidence for official acknowledgment. But what cannot be purchased with £15 million is what is still required: official government apology for UK's role in creating global homophobia, truth commission examining ongoing UK funding of persecution, curriculum changes teaching this history in schools, and public acknowledgment that the harm is real and the responsibility belongs with those who caused it.

The crisis infrastructure provides guarantees while reform happens—preventing deaths while you fix the systems. But what £5 million cannot buy is the institutional reform still required: ending all UK funding for anti-LGBTQ+ campaigns globally, NHS restructuring to ensure intersectional competence, ending hostile environment policies, asylum protection for those fleeing UK-exported homophobia, employment and housing protections actually enforced, police accountability with community oversight, and education reform reversing Section 28's legacy.

Money is necessary. But money alone is not sufficient. What is required is transformation.

## TOTAL: £110M + FREEDOM

Break it down by UN principle:
- Restitution: £50M (community centers)
- Compensation: £35M (peer support workers + therapy subsidy)
- Rehabilitation: £25M (research + crisis infrastructure + joy interventions)
- Satisfaction: Research initiative + official acknowledgment still required
- Guarantees: Crisis infrastructure + institutional reform still required

Break it down by responsible party:
- State: £70M (restitution, research, crisis response, joy)
- Businesses: £25M (peer support—backpay for invisible labor)
- Families: £10M (therapy subsidy—healing from rejection trauma)
- Police: £5M (crisis infrastructure—safety you failed to provide)

But the actual total due is not £110 million. The actual total is freedom. Liberation. Justice. The capacity for Black queer people in the UK to exist without daily mental health crisis created by intersecting oppressions.

Money cannot restore what was stolen. Money cannot bring back those lost. Money cannot undo 400 years of harm.

But under international law, reparations are required. And liberation work needs resources.

This £110 million resources leaders already doing the work of healing and liberation. It transfers payment from victims to responsible parties. It funds interventions with proven mental health impact. It is justice, not charity. Legal obligation, not goodwill.

## PART 5: THE LIBERATION MOVEMENT IS NOW

We are not waiting for permission to heal ourselves. Liberation is happening now.

You can join it—through IVOR, our trauma-informed AI offering 24/7 support and resources at blkout.vercel.app. Through BLKOUT Events, finding healing circles and community gatherings that end isolation at blkout.vercel.app/events. Through BLKOUTHUB, networking with other UK Black queer people for professional support, mentorship, and authentic connection at blkout.vercel.app/hub. Through News, seeing yourself reflected in community victories and resistance stories at blkout.vercel.app/news. Through Governance, participating in democratic co-ownership of our platform at blkout.vercel.app/governance.

You can support the broader movement—by endorsing the Black Mental Health Manifesto at bmhwa.co.uk/the-manifesto and building solidarity across our communities. By organizing in your workplace, union, community group, or faith community for mental health reparations. By demanding your MP support this transfer of payment from victims to responsible parties.

You can amplify this briefing on social media, sharing it with those who need to understand what reparations mean in practice, what liberation looks like in action, what mental health justice requires in resources.

Or you can do nothing—and watch as victims continue paying your bill with their lives while we free ourselves anyway.

## CONCLUSION: THE TREE REMEMBERS

The axe forgets what the tree remembers. Society's oppression created our mental health crisis. We are currently paying society's debt with our lives, labor, health, and futures. But we are not just surviving. We are leading resistance. We are reclaiming what was stolen. We are building liberation that heals mental health more effectively than systems designed to pathologize us.

Our liberation practices are mental health interventions. BLKOUT ends isolation through community. Mutual aid provides material security enabling healing. Cultural reclamation heals identity crisis. Peer support validates through lived experience. Joy regulates traumatized nervous systems.

£110M is not charity. It is transfer of payment from victims to responsible parties. It is resourcing liberation work that is already healing. It is legal obligation under international law. It is justice, not goodwill.

This is an account—financial, historical, and accountability. Community remembers what institutions would prefer to forget. This briefing is that remembering made material, that memory transformed into demand.

The tree remembers. And the tree is sending you a bill.
