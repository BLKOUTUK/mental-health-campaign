# Deployment Strategy: Mental Health Reparations Campaign

**BLKOUT Campaign Launch Plan**
*For and by Black queer men in the UK*

### "Why Now?" Urgency
- Seize window of opportunity (digital tools, visible inequality, global instability)
- Frame as historical moment for transformation
- UK demonstrating reparative justice while others debate
- Survival innovations becoming blueprints for systems change

**Joy as Strategy - Nightclub Takeover Series**:

*"It's Not My Revolution If I Can't Dance" - Emma Goldman (attributed)*

**Concept**:
Liberation requires pleasure, not just protest. Mental health reparations are about joy as much as justice. Nightclub takeovers demonstrate that healing includes celebration, community includes dancing, and revolution includes DJ sets.

**Execution**:
- Partner with Black queer nightlife spaces in major cities
- Monthly takeover events (first Saturday each month for 6 months)
- Campaign visuals integrated into club environment (projections, posters, LED screens)
- DJ sets curated by Black queer DJs
- Performances by Black queer artists (drag, spoken word, live music)
- Community testimonies between sets (3-5 minutes, powerful stories)
- Campaign materials available (policy briefings, sign-up sheets, donation boxes)
- Door donations support campaign (£5-20 suggested, no one turned away)
- Social media documentation showing liberation as joyful, not just struggle

**Cities & Venues**:
- London: Dalston Superstore, FOLD, Venue MOT
- Manchester: Partisan, The Eagle
- Birmingham: Missing, The Village
- Bristol: Dare to Club, The Attic Bar
- Leeds: Fibre, Viaduct Showbar
- Glasgow: AXM, Polo Lounge

**Nightclub Takeover Elements**:
- Campaign posters as club visuals (BLKOUT Red on LED screens)
- £543/year projected onto dance floor
- DJ drops campaign messaging between tracks
- Performers incorporate campaign themes into acts
- "What £543/year means to me" video testimonies playing in chill-out spaces
- Fundraising bar with campaign-themed drinks ("The £543", "Liberation Tonic")
- Photo booth with campaign props and BLKOUT branding
- Community members as event hosts/MCs
- Celebrity DJs or performers lending platforms

**Why This Matters**:
- Black queer nightlife is mental health infrastructure (connection, belonging, joy)
- Demonstrates liberation includes pleasure
- Reaches community where they already gather
- Counters trauma-only narratives about Black queer men
- Fundraising through community enjoyment, not guilt
- Media coverage shows campaign as joyful, attractive, alive
- Models what cultural centres will offer (arts, music, celebration, community)

**Tagline**: "£543/year = Community centres where you can dance, spaces where you belong, joy that heals. It's not revolution if you can't dance."

## Coalition Building Strategy

### Potential Allies (Prioritized)

**Tier 1: Critical Allies** (Share values, audience, and capacity)
- Black-led mental health organizations
- LGBTQ+ groups centering race (UK Black Pride, Kaleidoscope Trust)
- Community land trust networks
- Co-operative movement organizations
- Progressive unions (UNISON, GMB, NEU)

**Tier 2: Strategic Allies** (Reach or resources but require negotiation)
- Mainstream mental health charities (Mind, Rethink)
- Housing organizations (Shelter, Crisis)
- Broader LGBTQ+ organizations (Stonewall, with clear race equity commitment)
- Academic institutions (research partnerships)
- Progressive media outlets (Guardian, Tribune, Novara)

**Tier 3: Opportunistic Allies** (Specific moments or actions)
- Progressive MPs and councillors
- **Celebrities and influencers**: Black British LGBTQ+ artists, musicians, actors; mental health advocates with platforms; cultural figures who understand intersectionality
- International reparations movements
- Faith communities with LGBTQ+ inclusion commitments

### Celebrity Co-Promotion Strategy

**Potential Celebrity Champions** (Black British LGBTQ+ or Strong Allies):
- Musicians: MNEK, Arlo Parks, Joy Crookes, Little Simz (if LGBTQ+ affirming)
- Actors: Ncuti Gatwa, Letitia Wright (if LGBTQ+ affirming), T'Nia Miller
- Media personalities: Clara Amfo, Munroe Bergdorf, Travis Alabanza
- Athletes: Openly LGBTQ+ Black British athletes
- Influencers: Black British LGBTQ+ content creators with significant followings

**What We Ask of Celebrity Allies**:
- Social media amplification (share poster, policy briefing, personal testimony videos)
- Attend/perform at nightclub takeover events
- Record video endorsement explaining why £543/year matters
- Use platform to pressure government/NHS/foundations
- Donate or fundraise (without making campaign about them)
- Attend launch event or major actions
- OpEds or interviews discussing campaign

**What We Won't Accept**:
- Performative support without substance
- Taking over campaign narrative or becoming "face" of movement
- Using campaign for their brand without genuine commitment
- Appearing at events then disappearing
- Support that centers them, not community

**Celebrity Engagement Protocol**:
1. Community vets all celebrity partnerships
2. Celebrities briefed on campaign principles and history
3. Clear guidelines: Amplify community voices, don't replace them
4. Celebrities connect us to their networks (funders, media, other celebs)
5. Recognition that celebrities come and go; community remains

### Coalition Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Community Control**: Black queer men maintain decision-making power
2. **Amplify, Don't Speak Over**: Allies platform community voices, don't replace them
3. **No White-Washing**: Campaign specificity to Black queer men preserved
4. **No Rainbow-Washing**: This is not generic LGBTQ+ issue, intersectionality centered
5. **Financial Support, No Strings**: Money welcome but no conditions undermining vision
6. **Solidarity, Not Charity**: Partnership of equals, not savior dynamics
7. **Accountability**: Allies held accountable to community, not vice versa

### Coalition Engagement

**What We Ask**:
- Amplify campaign on social media
- Endorse policy briefing in your networks
- Co-sponsor events and actions
- Provide resources (funding, venues, expertise) without strings
- Connect us to your contacts (MPs, funders, media)
- Show up for our actions and events

**What We Won't Accept**:
- Taking credit for our work
- Watering down our demands
- Replacing community spokespeople with your staff
- Using our campaign for your fundraising without our consent
- Pressuring us to make campaign more "palatable"
- Conditional support ("we'll help if you change X")

## Media Strategy

**Reactive Engagement**:

**Key Messages** (Consistent Across All Media):
1. "£543/year per person - less than winter fuel payment"

3. "Community-led innovation with 42% reduction in suicidal ideation"

## Risk Mitigation

### Anticipated Risks

**Co-optation**:
- *Risk*: White LGBTQ+ orgs or mainstream mental health charities taking over
- *Mitigation*: Clear governance documents, coalition principles enforced, community veto power

**Dilution**:
- *Risk*: Pressure to make campaign less radical, more "palatable" to funders
- *Mitigation*: Democratic community votes on any message changes, no compromise on core principles

**Backlash**:
- *Risk*: Right-wing media attacks, institutional resistance, public criticism
- *Mitigation*: Media training, legal support, community solidarity structures, prepared responses

**Burnout**:
- *Risk*: Campaign organizers exhausting themselves
- *Mitigation*: Campaign models mutual aid, rotation of responsibilities, paid roles when funding available, rest built into timeline

**Funding Strings**:
- *Risk*: Money offered with conditions undermining community control
- *Mitigation*: Clear funding principles, community approval required for all grants, willing to reject funding with strings

**Internal Conflict**:
- *Risk*: Disagreements within community about strategy or priorities
- *Mitigation*: Democratic processes, transparent decision-making, conflict resolution protocols, commitment to solidarity despite disagreement

### Crisis Response Plan

**If Hostile Media Attack**:
1. Rapid response team issues statement
2. Community spokespeople give coordinated interviews
3. Coalition allies amplify defense
4. Legal advocacy assesses defamation claims
5. Community assembly processes collectively

**If Funding Rejected**:
1. Transparent communication about rejection
2. Community assembly decides next steps
3. Celebrate what was built regardless of funding
4. Pivot to smaller-scale actions or alternative funding
5. Document learnings for future attempts

**If Internal Conflict Escalates**:
1. Pause public campaign until resolved internally
2. Facilitated community dialogue
3. Democratic vote on contested issues
4. Respect dissent while maintaining unity of action
5. Allow for multiple strategies if community cannot reach consensus
