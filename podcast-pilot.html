            <div class="subtitle">A Pilot Podcast for Mental Health Reparations</div>
        </header>

        <div class="doc-meta">
            <h2>Introducing the Proposal Through Collective Conversation</h2>
            <p>A single pilot episode using an innovative relay interview format where participants rotate between interviewer and interviewee, embodying the co-production values at the heart of the mental health reparations proposal. Each voice both questions and is questioned, creating a democratic space where expertise is collective and transformation is shared.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Relay Format</h2>

        <p>The relay format positions participants as both subject and object, both petitioned and petitioner. After a brief introduction, six participants engage in 7-minute segments where each person:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Answers questions</strong> from the previous participant (7 minutes)</li>
            <li><strong>Transitions to interviewer role</strong> to question the next participant</li>
            <li><strong>Passes the baton</strong> continuing the relay until it returns to the anchor</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This structure creates urgency (time pressure demands clarity), democratises expertise (everyone is both teacher and learner), and embodies collective intelligence (understanding builds through conversation, not monologue).</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "Without community, there is no liberation. This format makes that visible—we're not individuals speaking to an audience, we're a community thinking together."
        </div>

        <h2>Pilot Episode: "Beginning the Conversation"</h2>

        <h3>Duration</h3>
        <p>45 minutes total (5-minute introduction + 6 × 7-minute segments = 47 minutes including transitions)</p>

        <h3>Episode Goal</h3>
        <p>Introduce the mental health reparations proposal through six voices that represent different relationships to the work: lived experience, clinical practice, research, commissioning, community organising, and policy-making. By the end, listeners understand what's being proposed, why it matters, who it's for, and how they can engage.</p>

        <h2>The Six Participants</h2>

        <div class="participant-box">
            <h4>1. Anchor Participant: Jamal (Black Gay Man, 28, Birmingham)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Community organiser and mental health advocate with lived experience of mental health crisis and recovery</p>
            <p><strong>Why Jamal:</strong> Anchors the episode in lived experience while demonstrating leadership and expertise. Opens and closes the relay, creating circular structure.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Perspective:</strong> "The system wasn't built for us. This proposal is about building what should have always existed."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="participant-box">
            <h4>2. Dr. Amara Thompson (Black Lesbian Psychologist, 45, London)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Clinical psychologist specialising in trauma and minority stress</p>
            <p><strong>Why Dr. Thompson:</strong> Brings clinical credibility and can translate lived experience into mental health frameworks. Can speak to why culturally-specific approaches work.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Perspective:</strong> "Generic mental health services aren't failing Black queer men by accident—they were never designed to succeed with us."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="participant-box">
            <h4>3. Professor Michael Adeyemi (Nigerian British Researcher, 52, Manchester)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Professor of Public Health researching LGBTQ+ health inequalities</p>
            <p><strong>Why Prof. Adeyemi:</strong> Provides evidence base and can contextualise the proposal within broader health policy and research landscapes.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Perspective:</strong> "We have decades of research showing the problem. This proposal is about finally matching the scale of the solution to the scale of the harm."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="participant-box">
            <h4>4. Sarah Chen (NHS Commissioner, 38, Leeds)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Mental health commissioning lead with responsibility for LGBTQ+ health</p>
            <p><strong>Why Sarah:</strong> Represents the system side—understands budgets, procurement, service specifications. Can speak to what makes proposals implementable.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Perspective:</strong> "Commissioners want to fund what works. This proposal gives us a roadmap with evidence, costings, and outcomes we can measure."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="participant-box">
            <h4>5. Marcus Williams (Black Trans Man, 31, Bristol)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Peer support worker and community organiser focused on housing and mental health</p>
            <p><strong>Why Marcus:</strong> Brings intersectional perspective (trans + Black + working class), represents grassroots organising, speaks to structural determinants.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Perspective:</strong> "You can't therapy your way out of structural violence. This proposal understands that mental health is housing, employment, safety, and community."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="participant-box">
            <h4>6. Councillor David Okafor (Local Government, 44, London)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Cabinet member for health and social care, Borough of Southwark</p>
            <p><strong>Why Cllr Okafor:</strong> Represents political will and local implementation. Can speak to how national proposals become local action.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Perspective:</strong> "This isn't just a mental health proposal—it's economic justice, workforce development, and community power. That's why it's politically viable."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Episode Structure: The Relay in Action</h2>

        <div class="relay-segment">
            <h4>Introduction (5 minutes)</h4>
            <div class="segment-meta">Host: Dr. Rob Berkeley, Director of BLKOUT</div>
            <p>Sets context for the proposal, explains the relay format, introduces why this conversation matters now. Brief introductions of all six participants (30 seconds each).</p>
            <p><strong>Key Frame:</strong> "This isn't a traditional interview because the work isn't traditional. Mental health reparations require collective thinking. So we're going to think together."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="relay-segment">

                    <li>When I was in crisis, the therapist didn't understand my family, my church, or what it meant to be Black and gay. Is that just my experience?</li>
                    <li>What does the research say about why we're 5 times more likely to need mental health support?</li>
                    <li>Can therapy actually work if the therapist doesn't get your life?</li>

                    <li>This proposal suggests 35,000 Black queer men need support. How did we get that number?</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>As a commissioner, I fund therapy. You organise around housing. What am I missing?</li>
                    <li>This proposal includes employment support and peer networks alongside therapy. Why?</li>
                    <li>What does "mental health reparations" mean when you're organising at street level?</li>

                <h4>Final Question from Cllr Okafor:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jamal, you started this relay. We've heard from clinicians, researchers, commissioners, organisers, and politicians. If this actually happened—if we secured the funding and delivered this proposal—what changes for you personally? For your community?</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recording:</strong> Professional studio (1 day: 4 hours recording + 2 hours setup/breakdown)</li>

        <div class="impact-box">
            <h3>Why This Pilot Matters</h3>
            <p>The relay format isn't just innovative audio—it's the proposal's values made audible. When listeners hear six people thinking together, building on each other's expertise, moving seamlessly between lived experience and policy analysis, they're experiencing what co-production sounds like.</p>
            <p>The pilot demonstrates that mental health reparations isn't one person's idea or one organisation's agenda. It's a collective understanding emerging from community knowledge, clinical practice, research evidence, and political possibility. The format makes that visible—or rather, audible.</p>
            <p>If the pilot succeeds, it creates a template for ongoing dialogue. The relay can continue, bringing in new voices, exploring specific aspects of implementation, tracking progress as the proposal moves towards funding and delivery. But it starts here: six voices, 45 minutes, a conversation that invites everyone listening to join.</p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Secure pilot funding:</strong> £5,500 for single episode production</li>
            <li><strong>Recruit participants:</strong> Approach potential participants with invitation and concept</li>
            <li><strong>Finalise questions:</strong> Work with participants to develop question framework</li>
            <li><strong>Schedule recording:</strong> Find date that works for all six participants + host</li>
            <li><strong>Produce and launch:</strong> Execute production plan and distribute widely</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This pilot isn't the end of the conversation—it's the beginning. Let's start talking.</p>
